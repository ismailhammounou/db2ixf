"""
Helps the user to parse PC/IXF file format of IBM DB2.

IXF file is organised in a sequence of records.
these records have 5 main types: Header, Table, Column Descriptor, Data and Application.

Inside the IXF file, these records are ordered which means that it starts with a header record,
table one, set of column descriptors - where each column descriptor is also a record -
ant it ends with the set of data records.

IXF = H + T + Set(C) + Set(D).

Each record type is represented by a list of fields and each field has a length in bytes that
we will use to read data from the IXF file.

For more information about record types; Please visit this
[link](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=format-pcixf-record-types).


Data records [Set(D)] stores the data we want to extract, which means that
for each column we need to extract its content from the data record.
Each column has its data type.
