DB2IXF parser is an open-source python package that simplifies the parsing and
processing of IBM Integration eXchange Format (IXF) files. IXF is a file format
used by IBM's DB2 database system for data import and export operations. This
package provides a streamlined solution for extracting data from IXF files and
converting it to various formats, including JSON, JSONLINE, CSV, Parquet and
Deltalake.

## Features

- **Parse IXF files**: The package allows you to parse IXF files and extract the
  rows of data stored within them.
- **Convert to multiple formats**: The parsed data can be easily converted to
  _JSON_, _CSV_, _Parquet_, or _Deltalake_
  format, providing flexibility for further analysis and integration with other
  systems.
- **Support for file-like objects**: IXF Parser supports file-like objects as
  input, enabling direct parsing of IXF data from file objects, making it
  convenient for handling large datasets without the need for intermediate file
  storage.
- **Minimal dependencies**: The package has few dependencies (ebcdic, pyarrow,
  deltalake, chardet, typer) which are automatically installed alongside the
  package.
- **CLI**: command line tool called ``db2ixf`` comes with the package. (_Does
  not support Deltalake format_)

## Hypothesis

- 1O1: **One** IXF file contains **One** table.

#### Parsing an IXF file

```python
# coding=utf-8
from pathlib import Path
from db2ixf import IXFParser

path = Path('path/to/IXF/file.XXX.IXF')
with open(path, mode='rb') as f:
    parser = IXFParser(f)
    rows = parser.parse()
    for row in rows:
        print(row)
```

#### Converting to JSON

```python
# coding=utf-8
from pathlib import Path
from db2ixf import IXFParser

path = Path('path/to/IXF/file.XXX.IXF')
with open(path, mode='rb') as f:
    parser = IXFParser(f)
    output_path = Path('path/to/output/file.json')
    with open(output_path, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as output_file:
        parser.to_json(output_file)
```

#### Converting to JSONLINE

```python
# coding=utf-8
from pathlib import Path
from db2ixf import IXFParser

path = Path('path/to/IXF/file.XXX.IXF')
with open(path, mode='rb') as f:
    parser = IXFParser(f)
    output_path = Path('path/to/output/file.jsonl')
    with open(output_path, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as output_file:
        parser.to_jsonline(output_file)
```

#### Converting to CSV

```python
# coding=utf-8
from pathlib import Path
from db2ixf import IXFParser

path = Path('path/to/IXF/file.XXX.IXF')
with open(path, mode='rb') as f:
    parser = IXFParser(f)
    output_path = Path('path/to/output/file.csv')
    with open(output_path, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as output_file:
        parser.to_csv(output_file)
```

#### Converting to Parquet

```python
# coding=utf-8
from pathlib import Path
from db2ixf import IXFParser

path = Path('path/to/IXF/file.XXX.IXF')
with open(path, mode='rb') as f:
    parser = IXFParser(f)
    output_path = Path('path/to/output/file.parquet')
    with open(output_path, mode='wb') as output_file:
        parser.to_parquet(output_file)
```

#### Converting to Deltalake

```python
# coding=utf-8
from pathlib import Path
from db2ixf import IXFParser

path = Path('path/to/IXF/file.XXX.IXF')
with open(path, mode='rb') as f:
    parser = IXFParser(f)
    output_path = 'path/to/output/'
    parser.to_deltalake(output_path)
```

For a detailed story and usage, please refer to the
[documentation](https://ismailhammounou.github.io/db2ixf/).

#### Precautions

There are cases where the parsing can fail and sometimes can lead to data loss:

1. Completely corrupted ixf file: It is usually an extraction issue.
2. Partially corrupted ixf file, it contains some corrupted Rows/Lines that the
   parser can not parse.
    1. Parser calculates rate of corrupted rows then compares it to an accepted
       rate of corrupted rows which you can set by this environment variable
       `DB2IXF_ACCEPTED_CORRUPTION_RATE`(int = 1)%.
    2. If the rate of corrupted rows is bigger than the accepted rate the parser
       raises an exception.
3. Unsupported data type : please contact the owners/maintainers/contributors so
   you can get help otherwise any PR is welcomed.

###### Case: encoding issues

````text
Parsing can lead to data loss in case the found or the detected encoding is 
not able to decode some extracted fields/columns. 

Parser tries to decode using:
    
    1. The found encoding (found in the column record)
    
    2. Other encodings like cp437
  
    3. The detected encoding using a third party package (chardet)
  
    4. Encodings like utf-8 and utf-32
  
    5. Ignore errors which can lead to data loss !

Before using the package in production, try to test in debug mode so you can
detect data loss.
